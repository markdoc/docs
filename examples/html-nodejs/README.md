Example HTML / Node.js setup using Markdoc and [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)

We use [Lit](https://lit.dev/docs/) to simplify organizing and creating our Web Components but you can use native Web Component browser features directly to build your own set of custom elements.

To run: 
1. Download the project.
2. Run `npm install` and `npm run build` to build the components. 
3. Run `npm run start` to start the server. 
4. View the sample Markdoc page at `http://localhost:4242`.
