# React + Node Markdoc Example

This example includes two applications:

- A client app created with [Vite](https://vite.dev/)'s `react` template
- A basic Node backend that provides a simple API

To start both applications, run `npm run start`, then view the client app in your browser at `http://localhost:5173/`.

To build the production version, run `npm run build` to bundle the static files, then start the Node server with `node server.js`.
