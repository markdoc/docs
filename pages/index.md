# Markdoc is a powerful, flexible, Markdown-based authoring system

Markdoc is a lightweight text markup language, built and used by [Stripe Docs](https://stripe.com/docs), that extends [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Where possible, Markdoc reuses native Markdown syntax to keep the format simple, and as close to the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) standard as possible. Markdocâ€™s extensions are designed to be both composable and minimally intrusive.
