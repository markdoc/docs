# {% $markdoc.frontmatter.title %}

With Markdoc, you can use frontmatter to apply metadata to your documents. Markdoc isn't opinionated when it comes to frontmatter, so you can use YAML, TOML, JSON, GraphQLâ€”pretty much any data format you want.

## Examples

```yaml
---
title: Authoring in Markdoc
description: Quickly author amazing content with Markdoc systax, a superset of Markdown.
date: 2022-04-01
---
```


```toml
+++
title = "Authoring in Markdoc"
description = "Quickly author amazing content with Markdoc systax, a superset of Markdown."
date = "2022-04-01"
+++
```

```json
{
  "title": "Authoring in Markdown",
  "description": "uickly author amazing content with Markdoc systax, a superset of Markdown.",
  "date": "2022-04-01"
}
```

```graphql
{
  page {
    title
    description
    date
  }
}
```
